# final_projections
Takes projected submarine melt rates and converts into projected retreat

## Kdistribution_17feb.mat
Contains a matlab distribution for the kappa variable that appears in the retreat parameterisation. The distribution is generated by considering past retreat and submarine melt rate as described in Slater et al. 2019, The Cryosphere (https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/13/2489/2019/)

## create_K_samples.m
Randomly samples kappa values from the kappa distribution; creates Ksamples.mat

## Ksamples.mat
Contains the randomly sampled kappa values. Saved as static values so that the results are reproducible.

## retreat_projections.m
Combines the sampled kappa values with projected submarine melt rates to produce projected retreat. Saves results as a matlab structure projected_retreat.mat, which includes both retreat and projected thermal forcing which some models used to projected floating ice submarine melt rate.

## projected_retreat.mat
Matlab structure containing projected retreat and thermal forcing per sector, per model, per scenario, per low/medium/high, per year.

## saveplot.m
Script to save plots
